# Hi I'm Ysa, and I'm learning to code.
I'm a former Civil Engineering student that shifted in Computer Science. I hope to specialize in Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, or Artificial Intelligence.
It's kinda hard rn but I'll pull through. :')
~~I hope I'm still alive by the end of it.~~

Oh yeah. Here's my strawpage if you wanna leave something for me <3
